# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## Project Description
This project aims to predict survival on the Titanic dataset using various machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two files: train.csv and test.csv, containing training and testing data respectively. The dataset includes information about passengers such as their age, sex, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether they survived or not.

## Usage
- Setup Kaggle API: Ensure you have the Kaggle API installed and authenticated. "/n"
- Download Dataset: Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
- Extract Dataset: Extract the downloaded dataset files.
- Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and converting categorical variables to numerical ones.
- Modeling: Train different machine learning models on the preprocessed data.
- Evaluation: Compare the performance of different models.
- Generate Predictions: Generate predictions on the test set.

## Models
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the dataset:

* Support Vector Machines
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Naive Bayes
* Perceptron
* Linear SVC
* Decision Tree
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Conclusion
Based on the evaluation, the Gradient Boosting Classifier was selected for generating predictions on the test set.
